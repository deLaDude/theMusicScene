# the Music Scene : Chrome Extension
The goal of this extension is to provide integrated enhancements for Turntable power users. The initial focus is on better queue management, but a spectrum of features will come in the future.

Checkout our [trello boards](https://trello.com/themusicscene) to see how development is going. 

Join the discussion, report issues and get the latest updates at our [google community](http://bit.ly/tmsCommunity).

## IMPORTANT NOTE: 
The playlist features **do not sync** with the turntable queue panel so you should only use one or the other for editing until the playlist features are completed.

This extension is **currently in Alpha development**. Bugs and odd behavior is to be expected. If you want to play around with it I suggest you review the [bug board](https://trello.com/board/bugs/510ed90a44cb4a1874003d47) first to avoid issues.
